# Inventory Management System
-----------
## Project Description
This student information manager is a very simple script that uses arrays, functions, and loops to manage and display details about students. The script takes three arrays of data and displays connected data in individual cards for the user. This script also explores the use of the static keyword and the scoping of variables.
